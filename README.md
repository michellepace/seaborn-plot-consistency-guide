# The Seaborn Plot That Looked Just Like The Others

A practical guide to creating consistent visualisations in Seaborn using the new `seaborn.objects` API. This notebook demonstrates how to maintain visual consistency across your data visualisations with minimal effort.

**IMPORTANT EDIT:** 

Read this notebook for concepts, but use Plotly Express (100%). The notebook explains the reasons. Wish I had found it sooner and not followed the crowd on Seaborn.
